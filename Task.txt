Task: Implement a Scalable RESTful API with OAuth2 Authentication
-----------------------------------------------------------------


Objective:
  Develop a RESTful API for a web application that will allow external clients to interact with the platform's data securely. The API should be scalable and capable of handling a high number of requests. Additionally, implement OAuth2 for secure authentication and authorization.



Requirements:
--API Design & Documentation:

    1- Design the API endpoints following RESTful principles.
    2- Ensure the API is versioned (e.g., /api/v1/).
    3- Provide comprehensive API documentation using tools like Swagger or Postman.
    4- Include proper HTTP status codes for error handling and successful operations.



Database Interaction:
  Implement CRUD operations for a sample resource (e.g., products, users).
  OAuth2 Implementation:

    1- Set up OAuth2 server-side using a PHP library like league/oauth2-server or integrate with a third-party service.
    2- Allow clients to obtain access tokens using client credentials or authorization code grant.
    3- Ensure the API validates and scopes tokens appropriately.
    4- Rate Limiting & Throttling:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse (e.g., 100 requests per minute per user).
    2- Throttle requests when limits are reached, returning appropriate status codes (e.g., 429 Too Many Requests).




Security Measures:
  1- Sanitize and validate all input data.
  2- Implement measures to prevent SQL Injection, XSS, and CSRF attacks.





Deliverables:
  1- A fully functional API with OAuth2 authentication.
  2- API documentation available online or as a downloadable file.
  3- Source code hosted in a Git repository with commit history.
